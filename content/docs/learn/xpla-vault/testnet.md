# Testnet

The testnet is the testing environment for the XPLA Chain. Use this guide to simulate transactions on the testnet.

If this is your first time using XPLA Vault, follow the [XPLA Vault tutorial]({{< ref "xpla-vault" >}}).

## Get Testnet XPLA
1. Open web wallet and connect your extension wallet.
2. In the bottom left corner of XPLA Vault, switch **Mainnet** to **Testnet**.
2. Copy your wallet address. Your wallet address will appear at the top of the XPLA web vault near your wallet name. Your wallet address will look like this: `xpla<random-numbers-and-letters>`
3. Open your browser and navigate to the [XPLA Chain Faucet](https://faucet.xpla.io).
4. Paste your XPLA Chain address in the **Testnet address** field, select XPLA, and click **Send me tokens**.

You now have funds in your Testnet wallet. Use the testnet just like you would use the mainnet. Make sure to switch back to the mainnet to make real transactions.
